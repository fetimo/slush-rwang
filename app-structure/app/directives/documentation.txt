# Directives

All directives used in this Angular application should be placed in this
folder, even if they're only used in one place by one module. We want to be
able to show a developer new to a project all the moving parts at a glance.

## What?

Directives are used when:

- You need to do any DOM manipulation.
- You have a repeated widget or section of code that you want to consolidate
  into one component.
- You want to wrap arbitrary content in markup (lightboxes, modal windows,
  etc...)
- You need to listen to DOM events.

## How

Here's an example directive:

    (function() {
        'use strict';

        // Note: we're creating a sub module 'directive' of 'rwModuleName'
        angular.module('rwModuleName.directive', [])
            .directive('rwModuleName', function() {
                return {
                    restrict: 'A',
                    replace: 'true',
                    scope: {
                        world: '=world'
                    },
                    templateUrl: 'js/app/templates/directive/template.html',
                    link: function(scope, elem, attrs) {
                        console.log('rwModuleName with scope: ', scope);
                    }
                }
            });
    })();

Here's how you'd use that directive in a view:

    <div data-rw-module-name data-world="world"></div>

And in your controller...

    .controller('...', [function() {
        $scope.world = 'World!';
    }]);
