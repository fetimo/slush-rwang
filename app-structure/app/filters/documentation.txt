# Filters

All filters used in this Angular application should be placed in this
folder, even if they're only used in one place by one module. We want to be
able to show a developer new to a project all the moving parts at a glance.

## What?

Filters are used when:

- You need to format the value of an expression for display
- You need to refine a dataset based on a value

## How

For details on usage please see the [angular JS docs](https://code.angularjs.org/1.2.25/docs/guide/filter);
