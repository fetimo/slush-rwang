# Templates

All templates used by this angular application should be placed in one of
these two sub folders:

- directives
- views

Templates that are used by directives should be placed in the directives
subfolder.

Templates that are views of your angular application should be placed in the
views subfolder. This is generally only used when you're using routing and are
assigning controllers to templates in your module configuration.
