# Controllers

All controllers used in this Angular application should be placed in this
folder, even if they're only used in one place by one module. We want to be
able to show a developer new to a project all the moving parts at a glance.

## What?

Controllers are used to:

- Set initial states of `$scope` objects
- Add behaviour to `$scope` objects

## How

Here's an example controller:

    (function() {
        'use strict';

        // Note: we're creating a sub module 'controller' of 'moduleName'
        angular.module('moduleName.controller', [])
            .controller('moduleNameControllerName', ['$scope', '$rootScope', function($scope, $rootScope) {
                console.log('moduleNameControllerName registered with $scope:', $scope);

                $scope.world = 'World';
            }]);
    })();

Here's how you'd use that controller in a view:

    <div data-ng-controller="moduleNameControllerName">
    </div>


__What happens when we want to have two controllers under `moduleName`?__
